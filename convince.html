    <p> You may be wondering why pineapples don't belong on pizza. This is a very serious topic that can get very political. Pineapples don't belong on pizza because it ruins the taste. It's also a disgrace to the Italian culture because they were the ones who created pizza. You don't want to disappoint father Ramsay as well. Other people think pineapple on pizza is a good topping for pizza because they want to be creative and try new things. Even though that is true, the sweetness of the pineapple does not go well with the taste of the cheese. In conclusion, people should just forget about pineapple on pizza and end this arguement. You can find more information on the info page. </p>
